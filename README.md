## What it do

This is my simple starter for the MERN stack I inevitably fall back on. I may start out with something different, but it always evolves to this.

It has some opinionated basics in it already, including Mongoose & Passport for Auth and styled-components for CSS

## Quick Start

In the terminal (with yarn installed globally):

`git clone git@github.com:brianbuie/mern-starter.git "New Project" && cd "New Project" && yarn install && yarn new-project`

This will clone the repo, install dependencies, remove the git repo, remove the NEW-PROJECT.js script, and remove the "new-project" script entry in package.json

## TODO

Create a bash script to allow `new-mern-project [name]` (currently creates a "New Project" folder)

test build/deployment and add script
